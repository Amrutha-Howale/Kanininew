* ToString method is inherited from the Object class which is used
to get a string that represents the current object.
* It can also apply on the Stack. 
It returns a string which represents the current stack object.
* Object obj=new object();
  Console.WriteLine(obj.ToString);
output: System.Object

Override ToString:
* The ToString can be overridden to return a string that represents the object instance.
* ex: string obj=$"{this.name},{this.GetAge()},{this.height}";
return obj;
